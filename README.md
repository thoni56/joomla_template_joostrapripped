Modernized version of Joomla 3 template from defunct https://joostrap.com

## Origin

Once upon a time Philip Locke (not the actor) ran a web shop that
produced Joomla plugins and templates. However these were for Joomla 2
and 3, so when we upgraded our website to Joomla 4 some features
broke.

This is a stop-gap to gradually modernize this template so that it is
compatible with J4 and J5.

## Status

As this is not a rewrite, but an attempt to fix what breaks, if you
try it you will probably run in to other problems than the one we have
seen.

Also there is no packaging, so for now you need to copy the files into
the `templates` directory of your site, rather than what we would
like, and might be added at some time, install a template package.
